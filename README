The purpose of this software is to provide centralized control and monitoring for cryptocoin mining operations.

The structure of this tool consists of two independent parts:

1. A daemon process that:
   a) collects information and stores it into lightweight database files
   b) configures and controls external mining applicattions and devices, e.g. cgminer
   c) communicates via command line tools

2. A GUI to interface with the daemon process, as an alternative to command line interaction

The primary development platform for this software is currently raspberry pi. The GUI is structured as a web interface, with the intent that the system running the daemon will host a webserver to provide access to the GUI. Other configurations may be considered at a later time.

---------------------------
Dependencies:

Python 2.7 must be installed on the system running the daemon

To install the webui, see the webui subdirectory for instructions and install scripts
